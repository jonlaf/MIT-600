# MIT-600
Completed coursework from MIT 6.00

In 2017 I started taking the introduction to computer science and programming course through MIT's open courseware.

More info about this class (and MIT open courseware) can be found at this link:

This is a space for me to work on projects from that course, which are written in Python 2.7.13.
